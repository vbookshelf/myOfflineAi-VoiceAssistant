Quick Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------
- If the app doesn't start, make sure Ollama is running (look for its icon in your system tray/menu bar)
- If you see "connection refused", restart Ollama
- Make sure you've downloaded at least one model in Ollama before using the app
- For the voice (TTS) to work Kokoro needs two files: kokoro-v1.0.onnx, and voices-v1.0.bin
  These files are auto downloaded during the setup process.
However, if the voice is not working then please download these files manually and place them in the project folder:
kokoro-v1.0.onnx: https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx
voices-v1.0.bin: https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin
